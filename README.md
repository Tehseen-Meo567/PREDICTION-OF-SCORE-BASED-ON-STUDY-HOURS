# PREDICTION-OF-SCORE-BASED-ON-STUDY-HOURS
Prediction of student scores on basis of study hours through Machine Learning Algorithm 

ML Algorithm Suitable For this Predictor: Linear Regression

# What is Linear Regression Model?
A model in which there is direct relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
## General Equation of Linear Regression :  
                          Y= Ax+ Ao, 
                          where Y = dependent variable
                                X = Independent variable
                               Ao = Y-intercept or (A,Ax are coefficients)
  
## This is Supervised ML Model where  X= no. of study hours; Y= student scores, X and Y are directly proportional,that's why we choose Linear Regression Model.
then,
# What is Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm?
"Supervised ML algorithm is one that learns from labeled data, where each training example consists of input-output pairs."

In simple words, in our case, we have dataset having input(study hours) and output(student scores). Linear Regression will create relationship between input and output. Here labeled data is - student scores and model has to  predict output- student score if unknown student came with X study hours.

Let's take Question:
## What will be the predicted score if a student study 9.25 hrs./day?

# Let's Look at Output Graph/ Result

We got answer,that is :

                             80<y<90
(assume student score 89 marks when he spends 9.25 hrs/day)
